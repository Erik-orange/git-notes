## Terminal Basics

* `~` is an alias for `$HOME` directory.

* `.` denotes the current directory.

* `..` denotes the parent directory.

* `*` is the wildcard symbol, selects all files in the working directory.

* Press the `tab` key for auto completion in the command-line.

* `less` is a program that displays the contents of a file.

* `cat` is a program that prints the contents of one of more files to the console.

* `mv` moves or renames a file or directory.

* `cp` copies a file or directory. Similar to `mv`, but `cp` leaves the original in-place. Must use the `-r` flag to recursively copy a directory.

* `rm` removes a file or directory. Use the `-r` recursive flag to remove a directory and its contents.

* `mkdir` creates a new directory. Use the `-p` flag to create nested directories. 

* `touch` creates a new file, but also used to update timestamps on a file.

* Use `command` + `K` to clear the terminal screen
